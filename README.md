# Project Title : Streamlit Web based app Tutorial.

Streamlit is a popular Python library used for building interactive web applications for data science and machine learning projects. Here's a basic guide to getting started with Streamlit:

1. Installation
You can install Streamlit via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit
2. Create a Python Script
Create a new Python script (e.g., app.py) where you'll write your Streamlit application code.

3. Writing Your First Streamlit App
Here's a simple example of a Streamlit app that displays a title and a text input field:

python
Copy code
import streamlit as st

# Title
st.title('My First Streamlit App')

# Text input
user_input = st.text_input("Enter some text")

# Display the input
st.write("You entered:", user_input)
4. Running Your Streamlit App
To run your Streamlit app, open a terminal, navigate to the directory where your app.py file is located, and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will start a local server and open your default web browser with the URL http://localhost:8501, where you can view and interact with your Streamlit app.

5. Adding More Features
You can easily add more components to your Streamlit app, such as sliders, buttons, charts, and more. Here's an example of adding a slider:

python
Copy code
# Slider
number = st.slider("Pick a number", 0, 100, 50)
st.write("You picked:", number)
6. Deployment
Once you're satisfied with your Streamlit app, you can deploy it to various platforms, including Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or AWS. Each platform has its own deployment process, so be sure to refer to their documentation for specific instructions.
